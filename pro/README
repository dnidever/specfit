SPECFIT Upgrade Ideas

use a spectrum structure for everything in specfit.
have a program called something like specfit_mkstruct
that you give spec, wave, errspec, mask, and maybe
keywords to set what has already been done.
this should have flags for:
wavelog, npts, nused, prepared, setres, binsmooth, setres,
norm, the specpars parameters and other parameters.

then when each program (from specfit_prepspec)
operates on the structure the appropriate flags should
be set (prepared=1 if all the preparation tasks have
been done).  this make things much easier to deal
with and I won't have to constantly check the wavelength
array against the specpars.

Change specpars so that you input the number of pixels not w1:
w0, dw, npix, res
That way it will be easier to get the wavelength solution right.
Probably also input it as a structure, also include a "log"
tag.  Also, res can be an array for wavelength dependent resolution.
Things should still be double.
